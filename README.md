# Discord-Bots

To create a bot:

Turn on “Developer mode” in your Discord account.

Click on “Discord API”.

In the Developer portal, click on “Applications”. Log in again and then, back in the “Applications” menu, click on “New Application”.

Name the bot and then click “Create”.

Go to the “Bot” menu and generate a token using “Add Bot”.

Program your bot using the bot token and save the file.

Define other details for your bot under “General Information”.

Click on “OAuth2”, activate “bot”, set the permissions, and then click on “Copy”.

Select your server to add your bot to it.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

For hosting these scripts use discloud.com or replit.

These scripts are in python language.

Before using the scripts, kindly paste you bot token in "Enter Your Bot Token Here", Update channel ids and multiple with comma.

You can edit the messages and also you can mention any channel or role by using this <#Your=Channel-ID-OR-Role-ID>.

For Using Time Script

Change Your Time Region

Chnage Your Bot Token

Write this in requiremnts.txt to install packages if you are using Discloud.com
discord.py
pytz==2021.1
and also create packages_install.py
and write this in the crreated file.
import subprocess

subprocess.call(['pip', 'install', '-r', 'requirements.txt'])

Or if you are using replit.com
Then write this in requiremnts.txt to install packages
discord.py

To remove seconds from time then remove this :%S from line 41 and 48.

For disloud.com add discloud.config file.

If you are using discloud.com then also make these files in zip.

For any kind of help message me at JHONY BRAVO #0001 on Discord.

For using complain and announcement scripts.

Add user ids in complain script.

Enable attach files of the bot roles in the server to make it enable for sending annoucements with the picture.

If you are using combined then do the both steps.

For every bot script (Python) use discord.py in requirements.txt

Thank You!
